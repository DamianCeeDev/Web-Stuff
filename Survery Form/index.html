    <p id="description">Welcome to our survey, "Are You Human or AI?" This survey aims to explore the understanding and
        perception of artificial intelligence (AI) among participants. Whether you're a human curious about AI or an AI
        entity engaging with human experiences, your insights are valuable to us.

        Through a series of thought-provoking questions, we seek to understand how individuals perceive the
        capabilities, limitations, ethical considerations, and societal impacts of AI. Your responses will contribute to
        broader discussions surrounding the integration of AI into our daily lives and its implications for the future.

        Your participation is anonymous and greatly appreciated. By sharing your perspectives, you're helping us gain
        valuable insights into the evolving relationship between humans and AI. Thank you for taking the time to
        contribute to our research.</p>
